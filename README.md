Ecommerce-Backend-Project

In this project, I have made a backend of an e-commerce website using Express framework of NodeJS. We are already given the mysql-database in which there are different tables and their data. We've to write different queries for different endpoints to make them working.

You do also need to install mysql database onto your system. by writing the following commands. This will install NodeJS version-12 and npm version-6 on your system.

You can also check the version of NodeJS and npm by writing, node -v and npm -v on the terminal respectively.
